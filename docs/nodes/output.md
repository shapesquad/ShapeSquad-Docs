# Output

What's connected to the *Output* node gets shown on the mesh in the Viewport. There can be only one output node in the graph.

## Inputs

The *Output* node has one input - what you connect there will be mapped onto your selected mesh and shown in the Viewport.

::: tip NOTE

The *Output* node will only send its input to the Viewport if pinned. *Output* is pinned by default. Double-clicking on any other node will instead show the other node in the viewport. Double-clicking on a pinned node will remove the pin, and pin *Output* again.
